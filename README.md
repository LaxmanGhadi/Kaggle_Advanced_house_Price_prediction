# Advanced Home Price Prediction - Jupyter Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides an advanced approach to predicting home prices using machine learning techniques. It explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to build an accurate predictive model.

## Features
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature engineering techniques
- Training machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation
You can install the necessary dependencies using:
